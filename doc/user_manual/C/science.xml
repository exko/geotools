    <title>Computational Geometry</title>

    <para>
       Computational Geometry is the study of the analysis of geometric objects
       within a computational environment. Computational Geometry studies the 
       behaviour of geometric calculations within the discrete mathematics of 
       computer systems, develops algorithms for geometric objects, and examines
       issues of computational efficiency for geometric creation, analysis and 
       display.

    <title>Geodesy</title>

    <para>
       Geodesy is the study of the shape of the earth. Its core contribution to 
       Geographic Information Systems relates to the definition of georeferenced 
       coordinate locations.
