IMPORTANT!

The ant build scripts found in this directory are NO LONGER USED and will almost certainly NOT WORK.

GeoTools 2.0 is now built using Maven, a project management tool from the Apache project. 
You can find out more at http://maven.apache.org

For the latest build instructions which will work consult the GT2 developers guide at:
