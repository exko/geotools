  <H1>Comparing coordinate transformation to expected results</H1>

  <H2>OpenGIS test failures</H2>
  <P ALIGN="justify">The transformation from &quot;NAD27 / Idaho Central&quot;
  to &quot;NAD83 / Idaho Central&quot; do not give the expected value according
  OpenGIS tests. However, the ArcInfo commercial software gives the same result
  than our CTS library. We don’t know at this time if we missed some important
  parameter or if this is an error in the OpenGIS test suite.</P>

  <H2>Difference between ellipsoidal and spherical cases</H2>
  <P ALIGN="justify">Most projection implementations use a special set of
  equations for spherical earth model (i.e. when the semi-major and semi-minor
  axis has the same length). In the particular case of the transverse Mercator
  projection, there is a discrepancy between the results of spherical and
  ellipsoidal equations when the point is far away from the central meridian.
  At the latitude of origin, the discrepancy in x is 0.003691 meters for a
  point at 10° from the central meridian. The discrepancy increases to 1.9498
  meters at 20° from the central meridian, and continue to increase steadily
  after this. The discrepancy varies also by latitude a bit. The graphics below
  show the discrepancy.</P>
