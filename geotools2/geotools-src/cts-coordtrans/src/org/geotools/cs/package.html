    <P ALIGN="justify">Coordinate Systems implementation. The
    {@link org.geotools.cs.CoordinateSystem} class is the base class for all
    coordinate systems. Coordinate systems can have an arbitrary number of
    dimensions. Some are two-dimensional (e.g. {@link org.geotools.cs.GeographicCoordinateSystem}
    and {@link org.geotools.cs.ProjectedCoordinateSystem}), while some others
    are one-dimensional (e.g. {@link org.geotools.cs.VerticalCoordinateSystem}
    and {@link org.geotools.cs.TemporalCoordinateSystem}). Those simple coordinate
    systems can be used as building blocks for more complex coordinate systems.
    For example, it is possible to construct a three-dimensional geographic
    coordinate system (<var>latitude</var>, <var>longitude</var>, <var>height
    above the ellipsoid</var>) with an aggregation of <CODE>GeographicCoordinateSystem</CODE>
    and <CODE>VerticalCoordinateSystem</CODE>. Such aggregations are
    built with {@link org.geotools.cs.CompoundCoordinateSystem}.</P>

    <P ALIGN="justify">While it is possible to create coordinate systems by
    direct instantiation (using their public constructors), the preferred way
    is to use methods in the {@link org.geotools.cs.CoordinateSystemFactory}
    class. Public constructors are not part of OpenGIS's specification, while
    <CODE>CoordinateSystemFactory</CODE> is. Furthermore,
    <CODE>CoordinateSystemFactory</CODE>'s methods can be overridden,
    which is useful for constructing <CODE>CoordinateSystem</CODE>s
    backed by some OpenGIS compliant commercial software.</P>
