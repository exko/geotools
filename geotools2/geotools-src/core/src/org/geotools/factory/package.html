    Utility classes which enable dynamic binding to factory implementations at
runtime.<p>
    Because the core module consists almost excusivly of interfaces Factories
play a vital role in how developers use the API.<p>
    Although the interfaces that are declared in core are implemented in
defaultcore you should not use classes in defaultcore directly.  Instead you
should use factories. <br> But if you can't use defaultcore how can you get at the
implementations of factories that are in it? <p> 

The answer is the FactoryFinder in this package, read its documentation for
details on how it works.
