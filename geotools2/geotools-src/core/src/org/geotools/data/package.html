  Defines the DataSourceAPI via which all data is imported or exported.
<p>
  All datasources (e.g. PostGIS, Shapefile(tm), GML...) must provide
implementations of the DataSource interface and the DataSourceFactorySpi
interface.  These interfaces allow new types of datasource to be plugged into
applications which use geotools without the need to modify any code.
<p>
For more information on how to write a new datasource, see the DataSource
javadocs, for more infomration on the Service Provider Interface mechanism used
to allow dynamic plugins see DataSourceFinder and DataSourceFactorySpi
