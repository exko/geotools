  <BODY>
    <P ALIGN="justify">A set of classes to monitor the progress of some operation.
    Progress may be monitored through the classical progress bar in a window
    ({@link org.geotools.gui.progress.SwingProgress}), through percents written
    on the standard output device ({@link org.geotools.gui.progress.PrintProgress}),
    or as mail reports send at fixed interval
    ({@link org.geotools.gui.progress.MailProgress}).</P>

    <P ALIGN="justify">A standard Java class already provides progress monitoring:
    {@link javax.swing.ProgressMonitor}. However, this package provides some
    supplemental facilities. 1) Progresses don't have to be monitored in a window
    and 2) this package support displaying warnings (with line source line number)
    or exception stack traces.</P>
