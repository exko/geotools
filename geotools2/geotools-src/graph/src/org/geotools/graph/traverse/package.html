The orgional graph package has been developed using the JUMP Feature API.
Its intension is to be able to aid automated skeletonization of water bodies by
computing directionality of generated skeletons.
The work for the original JUMP graph library was funded by the British Columbia Ministry of Sustainable Resource Management and the Canadian GeoConnections program.

This library has been ported to geotools2 as part of the VWFS project
sponcered by Geo Innovations.
If all goes well this will be included in a future release of geotools2.
