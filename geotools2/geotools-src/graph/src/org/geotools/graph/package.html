Graph classes that builds and walk networks based on Feature relationships.
<p>
This api follows the standard Builder Pattern for network generation, this may be 
customized by using your own FeatureComparator/FeatureRelator
(GOF stratagy Pattern).
</p>
<p>
Once constructed you may access your Graph using a walker (GOF vistor pattern).
Precanned Walkers exist for both edge and node based traversals.

<p>
The orgional graph package has been developed using the JUMP Feature API.
Its intension is to be able to aid automated skeletonization of water bodies by
computing directionality of generated skeletons.
The work for the orgiional JUMP based library has been funded 
by the BC Proventional Government department of BMGS.

<p>
This library has been ported to geotools2 as part of the VWFS project
sponcered by Geo Innovations.
If all goes well this will be included in a future release of geotools2.
