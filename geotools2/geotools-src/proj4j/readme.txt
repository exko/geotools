Proj4j is a java port of the PROJ Cartographic Projection Library which is written in C.

The port, performed by James Macgill is still very much underway and a number of features, let allone projections,
have yet to be implemented.

Licencing is an issue that will need to be discused further with the current PROJ maintainer, but for now, as this is a direct port
it will carry the same (MIT) licence as the current release of PROJ. Note that whilst I place the Copyright notice PROJ4J
would not have been possbible without the code in PROJ developed by Gerald Evenden and the subsequent develpments by 
Frank Warmerdam.

The current PROJ homepage can be found at:
http://www.remotesensing.org/proj/

The homepage for proj4j is likely to be geotools.org as this is the toolkit for which the port was made
http://www.geotools.org

If you have any coments or want to help complete the port then please contact me at:
