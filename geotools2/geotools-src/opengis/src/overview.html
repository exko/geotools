    implementation specification for coordinate transformation services. This
    implementation specification provides interfaces for general positioning,
    coordinate systems, and coordinate transformations. Coordinates can have
    any number of dimensions. So this specification can handle 2D and 3D
    coordinates, as well as 4D, 5D etc.</P>

    <P ALIGN="justify">All interfaced objects are immutable. This means that
    implementations must promise not to change an object's internal state once
    they have handed out an interface pointer. All mutable entities are
    implemented with classes.</P>

    <P ALIGN="justify">Since all interfaced objects are specified to be
    immutable, there do not need to be any constraints on operation sequencing.
    This means that these interfaces can be used in parallel computing
    environments (e.g. internet servers).</P>
