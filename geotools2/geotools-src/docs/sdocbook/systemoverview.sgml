  <para>Geotools2 is an open source, java GIS toolkit for developing standards
  compliant solutions. It&#39;s modular architecture allows extra
  functionality to be easily incorporated. Geotools 2 aims to support Open GIS
  and other relevant standards as they are developed.</para>

  <para>GeoTools 2 code is built using the latest Java tools and environments
  (Java 1.4.1 at time of writing) and will continue to leverage the
  capabilities of future Java environments and official extensions as and when
  the technologies are released and have been through the first maintenance
  cycle (i.e. version 1.x.1).</para>

  <para>The GeoTools2 project is divided into separate modules, each of which
  implements a specific requirement. Only a subset of these modules is usually
  required to build an application based on Geotools2.</para>
