  <para>This document provides comprehensive java software development
  processes tailored for open source projects. It covers processes,
  convensions, and recommended tools. The guide aims to help developers
  quickly get up to speed with best practices.</para>

  <para>You are not expected to read this guide cover-to-cover. You probably
  should be familiar with the contents and reference the appropriate section
  when you need it. Documentation aims to be concise with references elsewhere
  on the web for details like installation instructions.</para>

  <para>This guide is written in a modular fasion so that different projects
  can easilly add, delete, or modify sections. It is hoped that this guide
  will become the defacto standard software developers guide for java based
  open source projects.</para>

  <para>For this guide to be useful it needs to be continually added to and
  improved as tools are developed, processes improved and projects grow.
  Please consider improving or adding a section if you feel it is required.</para>

  <para>Only free, cross platform tools are recommended. Where applicable,
  widely accepted convensions and open standards are used. It has been
  satisfying to discover that quality free tools are available for the full
  software development lifecycle, with many of the tools being open source.</para>
