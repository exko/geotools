  <title>Identification.</title>

  <para>This document provides comprehensive java software development
  processes tailored for open source projects. It covers processes,
  conventions, and recommended tools. The guide aims to help developers
  quickly get up to speed with best practises.</para>

  <para>You are not expected to read this guide cover-to-cover. You probably
  should be familiar with the contents and reference the appropriate section
  when you need it. Documentation aims to be concise with references elsewhere
  on the web for details like installation instructions.</para>

  <para>This guide is written in a modular fashion so that different projects
  can easily add, delete, or modify sections. It is hoped that this guide will
  become the de-facto standard software developers guide for java based open
  source projects.</para>

  <para>For this guide to be useful it needs to be continually added to and
  improved as tools are developed, processes improved and projects grow.
  Please consider improving or adding a section if you feel it is required.</para>

  <para>Only free, cross platform tools are recommended. Where applicable,
  widely accepted conventions and open standards are used. It has been
  satisfying to discover the breadth of quality free and open source tools
  which support software development. It is hoped that this document will
  highlight areas where tools can be improved or developed and encourage
  developers to focus on these areas.</para>

  <para>This guide has been used as the basis for <ulink

  Software Developer&#39;s Guide.</para>
