    <title>Introduction</title>

    <para>This is a guide for developers who actualy want to use GeoTools 2 as
    part of their own project. Rembemer that GT2 is a toolkit an not an
    application so this guide is not targeted at end-users.</para>

    <para>If you are interested in developing GT2 iteslf then please refere to
    the Developers guide, if you are an end-user looking for an application
    then take a look at some of the projects that are based on GeoTools 2</para>

    <para>GeoTools 2 has been designed in a modular way so you can use as much
    or as little of it as you like. You can also develop your own extentions
    to it as seperate projects that are not part of the main GeoTools
    development source tree.</para>

    <para>Because of the modular nature of GeoTools 2 building it and using
    its jars can be complex, to simplify the process we recomend using the
    Maven project managment tool from Apache. If you use Maven to build your
    own project you will find using GeoTools 2 very much easier.</para>
