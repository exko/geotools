/**
 * The low-level interface for reading Features. Will use the underlying
 * AttributeReader and the given FeatureType to create new Features.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Typical use is as follows:
 * <pre><code>
 *   FeatureReader reader;
 *   ...
 *   Feature f = null;
 *   while ( reader.hasNext() ) {
 *      f = reader.next();
 * 
 *   }
 * 
 *   reader.close();
 * </code></pre>
 * Questions for Ian:
 * 
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 * Should FeatureReader provide access to the AttributeReaders it uses?
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * FeatureReader has a close method, but no open method? (This is probably by
 * design allowing FeatureReader to encapsulate its InputStream or Rowset). I
 * am going to assume that FeatureReaders are a single use proposition.
 * </li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * I've modified this to be based on the Iterator pattern as discussed in
 * email. The only question remaining is whether to include skip(int) or not.
