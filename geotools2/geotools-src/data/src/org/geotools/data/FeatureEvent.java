/**

 * The "Source" FeatureEvents is taken to be a <code>FeatureSource</code>,

 * hold of Transaction information.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * DataStore implementations will actually keep the list listeners by
 * DataSource, and can report FeatureWriter modifications as required (by
 * filtering the Listener list by typeName and Transaction).
 * </p>
 *

 * The commit opperation will also need to provide notification.
