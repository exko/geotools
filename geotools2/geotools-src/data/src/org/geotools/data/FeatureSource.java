 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Differences from DataStore:
 * </p>
 * 
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 * This is a prototype DataSource replacement, the Transaction methods have
 * been moved to an external object, and the locking api has been intergrated.
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * FeatureCollection has been replaced with FeatureResult as we do not wish to
 * indicate that results can be stored in memory.
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * FeatureSource has been split into three interfaces, the intention is to use
 * the instanceof opperator to check capabilities rather than the previous
 * DataSourceMetaData.
 * </li>
 * </ul>
