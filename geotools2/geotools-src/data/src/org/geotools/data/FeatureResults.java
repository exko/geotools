/**
 * Highlevel API for Features from a specific Query.
 * 
 * <p>
 * The can opperate as as a kind of Prepaired Query. It is a Query that knows
 * enough information to be rerun. We may wish to rename this class as
 * QueryResults.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Differences from FeatureCollection:
 * </p>
 * 
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 * This API opperates as a source of FeatureReaders (rather than a source of
 * iterators)
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * As a Prepaired Query thise class allows other "results" to be asked against
 * the same query. getBounds() is the most logical example, but we may be able
 * to think of others. In Candidate "results" should all be reproduceable by
 * streaming over the generated FeatureReader.
 * </li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Ideas:
 * </p>
 * 
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 * Chris had the idea of a collection() method that would construct a
 * FeatureCollection (by iterating through the FeartureReader once). This
 * would be a nice transition piece to allow us to test against existing
 * renderers. (we could add the method in deprecated form until the Renderers
 * adapt to the new API).
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * Ian had the idea of asynchronous error handling as provided by a High-Level
 * version of FeatureReader. This class might be the place for such work?
 * Something similar to jdbc getWarnings()?
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * The idea of forcing a CoordinateSystem is also looking for a home, this may
 * be the place for such work (although I recomend proving a a "hint" in the
 * Query interface).
 * </li>
 * </ul>
