/**
 * Interface for cloneable classes. A cloneable class implements the standard
 * {@link java.lang.Cloneable} interface from J2SE and additionnaly overrides
 * the {@link Object#clone()} method with public access. For some reason lost
 * in the mists of time, the J2SE's {@link java.lang.Cloneable} interface doesn't
 * declare the <code>clone()</code> method, which make it hard to use. This Geotools's
 * <code>Cloneable</code> interface add this missing method, which avoid the need to
 * cast an interface to its implementation in order to clone it.
