    Helper classes for {@link org.geotools.gc.GridCoverageExchange}.
    {@link org.geotools.io.coverage.GridCoverageReader} is the base class for any object
    capable to read a {@link org.geotools.gc.GridCoverage} object.</P>

    <P ALIGN="justify">Sometime, remote sensing data are not contained in a single file.
    For example it is common to find sample values in a raw binary file (a flat matrix),
    and metadata informations in a separated text file. There is a wide variety of formats
    for such text file, and supporting them is not always straightforward.
    {@link org.geotools.io.coverage.PropertyParser} is a helper class for making
    this kind of work easier.</P>
