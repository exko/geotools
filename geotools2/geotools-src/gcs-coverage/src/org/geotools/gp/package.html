    <P ALIGN="justify">Grid coverage processing implementation. The following is
    adapted from <A HREF="http://www.opengis.org/techno/specs/">OpenGIS® Grid
    Coverages Implementation Specification</A>:</P>

    <BLOCKQUOTE><FONT COLOR="#008060">
    <P ALIGN="justify">This optional interface provides operations for different
    ways of accessing the grid coverage values as well as image processing
    functionality. The list of available processing operations is implementation
    dependent. The interface has a discovery mechanism to determine the available
    processing operations. These processing operations will transform values
    within a single sample dimension, and leave the values in other sample
    dimensions unaffected. The modified sample dimension may also change its
    type (e.g. from <CODE>4BIT</CODE> to <CODE>1BIT</CODE>). The actual
    underlying grid data remains unchanged. The interface has been designed to
    allow the adaptations to be done in a "pipe-lined" manner. The interface
    operates on {@link org.geotools.gc.GridCoverage} to create a new 
    {@link org.geotools.gc.GridCoverage}. The interface does not need to
    make a copy of the source grid data. Instead, it can return a grid coverage
    object which applies the adaptations on the original grid coverage whenever
    a block of data is requested. In this way, a pipeline of several grid
    coverages can be constructed cheaply.</P>

    <P ALIGN="justify">This interface can perform any of the following:</P>

    <OL>
      <LI>Change the number of bands being accessed.</LI>
      <LI>Change the value sequencing in which the grid values are retrieved.</LI>
      <LI>Allow re-sampling of the grid coverage for a different geometry.
          Creating a new {@link org.geotools.gc.GridCoverage} with different
          grid geometry allows for reprojecting the grid coverage to another
          projection and another georeferencing type, resampling to another cell
          resolution and subsetting the grid coverage.</LI>
      <LI>Modify the way the grid values are accessed (filtered, classified...).</LI>
      <LI>Change the interpolation method used when evaluating points which fall
          between grid cells.</LI>
      <LI>Filtering</LI>
      <LI>Image enhancements.</LI>
      <LI>etc.</LI>

    <P ALIGN="justify">Possible values for type are: "NearestNeighbor", "Bilinear" and
    "Bicubic" (the "Optimal" interpolation type is currently not supported). The Geotools
    implementation provides two extensions to OpenGIS specification: First, it accepts
    also an {@link javax.media.jai.Interpolation} argument type, for interoperability
    with <A HREF="http://java.sun.com/products/java-media/jai/">Java Advanced Imaging</A>.
    Second, it accepts also an array of {@link java.lang.String} or {@link javax.media.jai.Interpolation}
    objects. When an array is specified, the first interpolation in the array is applied.
    If this interpolation returns a <code>NaN</code> value, then the second interpolation
    is tried as a fallback. If the second interpolation returns also a <code>NaN</code>
    value, then the third one is tried and so on until an interpolation returns a real
    number or until we reach the end of interpolation list. This behavior is convenient
    when processing remote sensing images of geophysics data, for example <I>Sea Surface
    Temperature</I> (SST), in which clouds may mask many pixels (i.e. set them to some
    <code>NaN</code> values). Because "Bicubic" interpolation needs 4x4 pixels while
    "Bilinear" interpolation needs only 2x2 pixels, the "Bilinear" interpolation is
    less likely to fails because of clouds (<code>NaN</code> values) than "Bicubic"
    (only one <code>NaN</code> value is enough to make an interpolation fails). One
    cans workaround the problem by trying a bicubic interpolation first, then a linear
    interpolation if "Bicubic" failed at a particular location, etc. This behavior
    can be provided with the following "Type" argument:
    <code>new String[]{"Bicubic", "Bilinear", "NearestNeighbor"}</code>.</P>

    <H2><A NAME="resample">Resample</A></H2>
    <P ALIGN="justify">Resample a grid coverage using a different grid geometry.
    This operation provides the following functionality:</P>
    <UL>
      <LI><strong>Resampling</strong><br>
          The grid coverage can be resampled at a different cell resolution.
          Some implementations may be able to do resampling efficiently at any
          resolution. Also a non-rectilinear grid coverage can be accessed as
          rectilinear grid coverage with this operation.</LI>
      <LI><strong>Reprojecting</strong><br>
          The new grid geometry can have a different coordinate system than the
          underlying grid geometry. For example, a grid coverage can be
          reprojected from a geodetic coordinate system to Universal Transverse
          Mercator coordinate system.</LI>
      <LI><strong>Subsetting</strong><br>
          A subset of a grid can be viewed as a separate coverage by using this
          operation with a grid geometry which as the same geoferencing and a
          region. Grid range in the grid geometry defines the region to subset
          in the grid coverage.</LI>
