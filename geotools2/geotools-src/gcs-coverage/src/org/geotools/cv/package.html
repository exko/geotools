    <P ALIGN="justify">The essential property of coverage is to be able
    to generate a value for any point within its domain. How coverage is
    represented internally is not a concern. For example consider the
    following different internal representations of coverage:</P>

    <OL>
      <LI>A coverage may be represented by a set of polygons which exhaustively
          tile a plane (that is each point on the plane falls in precisely one
          polygon). The value returned by the coverage for a point is the value
          of an attribute of the polygon that contains the point.<BR>&nbsp;</LI>
      <LI>A coverage may be represented by a grid of values. The value returned
          by the coverage for a point is that of the grid value whose location
          is nearest the point.<BR>&nbsp;</LI>
      <LI>Coverage may be represented by a mathematical function. The value
          returned by the coverage for a point is just the return value of the
          function when supplied the coordinates of the point as arguments.<BR>&nbsp;</LI>
      <LI>Coverage may be represented by combination of these. For example,
          coverage may be represented by a combination of mathematical functions
          valid over a set of polynomials.</LI>
