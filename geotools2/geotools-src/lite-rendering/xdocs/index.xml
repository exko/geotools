    <section name="Lite renderer">
      <p>
       A simple renderer implementation. It's supposed to be as simple as
       possible, thus easy to understand at the source level, and to use as few memory 
       as possible. Should be used when memory is a constraint and/or when the
       rendering is stateless (that is, the application is not an interactive
       viewer that displays the same map more than once). In the latter case, a
       renderer that uses more memory but avoids recomputing map rendering details
       should be preferred.
