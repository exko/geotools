Referencing is at one level a "pure" implementation of GeoAPI interfaces, up to the level of coordinate reference
systems. There is all kinds of fun reprojection stuff happening here, some of which is ported from
proj4 (with permission). There has been a lot of email on this subject, and I am going to let Martin
update this file with anything appropriate.



org.geotools.geometry
---------------------
Captures some geometry ideas, not yet a full implementation of the GeoAPI interfaces targeted.
IP:
- some files (C) 2004, Institut de Recherche pour le D�veloppement
- updated headers



org.geotools.measure
--------------------
Support for unit parameter objects capturing common constructs like angle and latitude.
IP:
- range of (C) found (and maintained) in headers
  (C) 2001, Institut de Recherche pour le D�veloppement
  (C) 1999, Fisheries and Oceans Canada
  (C) 1998, P�ches et Oc�ans Canada

The two last ("Fisheries and Oceans Canada" and "P�ches et Oc�ans Canada")
are actually the same thing and could be merged in a single copyright.
 
 - updated headers as to (C) 200x - 2006 PMC as required
 
 
org.geotools.nature
-------------------
 Collection of Algorithms for hacking at natural phenomenons.

 - updated headers
 - Calendar, SeaWater, SunRelativePosition contains note allowing JScience to distribute using BSD style license

   The full org.geotools.nature may be removed from Geotools distribution if
   JScience decide to includes them in their own distribution. JScience is
   probably a more appropriate place than Geotools for them.

org.geotools.referencing.factory
--------------------------------
Here is where factories are used to address some of the complexities of the who geospaital
"standard" scene :-)  The DatumAliasesTable.txt is used to great effect to allow the
various parsers to be more forgiving.

  guess that it matches DatumAliases.java

 - updated headers
 - scripts, not sure what this is.
   Answer from Martin: a kind of executable test suite in text form. Contains source and target CRS,
   source points and expected target points. The test suite performs the projection and fires a test
   failure if the computed points is significantly different than the target points specified in the
   script. The OpenGIS test script is modified from an OGC script. All other test scripts are Rueben
   Schulz's work (as far as I know). Rueben did this job as a Geotools contributor.
 - wkt for CoordinateReferenceSystem.txt - should confirm source of data?
   Answer for Martin: they are mostly test scripts with comments, source and target points trimmed out.
   So they are mostly Rueben's derivative work.
