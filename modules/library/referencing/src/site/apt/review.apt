    Rueben Shultz worked on this module but his name does not appear on the list 
      of vetted contributors.

Referencing is at one level a "pure" implementation of GeoAPI interfaces, up to 
the level of coordinate reference systems. There is all kinds of fun 
reprojection stuff happening here, some of which is ported from proj4 (with 
permission). There has been a lot of email on this subject, and I am going to 
let Martin update this file with anything appropriate.

Note beyond the Java ("*\.java") files there are some text files with copyright 
headers:
  cd modules/library/referencing
  find ./src -name "*\.txt"



org.geotools.geometry
---------------------
The minimal elements of geometry required for Referencing: DirectPosition and
Envelope.


org.geotools.measure
--------------------
Support for unit parameter objects capturing common constructs like angle and 
latitude.
 
 
org.geotools.nature
-------------------
 Collection of Algorithms for hacking at natural phenomenons.
 
 IP:
 - package html cites the following:
   
   http://webexhibits.org/calendars/year-astronomy.html
   http://www.treasure-troves.com/astro/TropicalYear.html
   Unesco technical papers in marine science #40,#44,#45,#50
   
   
 - Calendar, SeaWater, SunRelativePosition contain a note allowing JScience to 
   distribute those files using a BSD style license.

   The full org.geotools.nature may be removed from Geotools distribution if
   JScience decide to includes them in their own distribution. JScience is
   probably a more appropriate place than Geotools for them.


org.geotools.parameter
----------------------
Parameter implementation, informed by an OGC specification. Contains an 
breakdown of paramters and parameter groups with enough metadata to allow for 
automation.

 
org.geotools.referencing
------------------------
Contains the CRS utility class, a GeodeticCalculator and other high level api
for putting the referencing system to good use.

- OGC credited with some abstrations:
  
  This package contains documentation from OpenGIS specifications.
  OpenGIS consortium's work is fully acknowledged here.

- GeodeticCalculator contains the following reference:

org.geotools.referencing.crs
----------------------------
Implementation of coordinate reference systems, based on geoapi interfaces.

org.geotools.referencing.factory
--------------------------------
Here is where factories are used to address some of the complexities of the who 
geospaital "standard" scene :-)  The DatumAliasesTable.txt is used to great 
effect to allow the various parsers to be more forgiving.

org.geotools.referencing.factory.epsg
-------------------------------------
Contains base support for an EPSG support, compare and contrast with the 
referencing plugins for PostGRES, and HSQL and the like available in the plugin 
folder.

org.geotools.referencing.factory.wms
------------------------------------
Created by Refractions for a project in early 2004 and donated to the GeoTools 
community, supports additional AUTO projects defined by the WMS specification in 
Appendix B.


org.geotools.referencing.operation
----------------------------------
Seems to define various math operations, probably the basis for reprojection. 
Most files date from 2004.

IP:
- OGC credited with some abstrations:

org.geotools.referencing.operation.matrix
-----------------------------------------
Defines some basic matrix math, onto of Java 3D vecmath.


org.geotools.referencing.operation.projection
---------------------------------------------
Fun with math projections, this is interesting in that we have
been given permission to relicense some derrived code from the
proj4 project.

IP:
- Some algorithms ported from Proj4.
   Frank Warmerdam will sign the copyright agreement; we presume this covers
   Gerald Evenden's copyright. Both added as authors as appropriate. Frank had 
   perviously provided permission to relicense as LGPL. The package also 
   credits the USGS work with:

     This package contains formulas from the PROJ package of USGS.
     USGS's work is fully acknowledged here. This derived work has
     been relicensed under LGPL with Frank Warmerdam's permission.


org.geotools.referencing.operation.transform
--------------------------------------------
Math transformation functions.

IP:
- OGC credited with interfaces/documentation:

   This package contains documentation from OpenGIS specifications.
   OpenGIS consortium's work is fully acknowledged here.


org.geotools.referencing.wkt
----------------------------
Support for reading and writing well known text.


org.geotools.measure (test)
org.geotools.parameter (test)
org.geotools.referencing (test)
org.geotools.referencing.factory (test)
org.geotools.referencing.factory.wms (test)
org.geotools.referencing.operation (test)
org.geotools.referencing.operation.projection (test)
org.geotools.referencing.operation.transform (test)
org.geotools.resources (test)
----------------------------------------------------
Fun with JUnit.

IP:
 - scripts, not sure what this is.
   Answer from Martin: a kind of executable test suite in text form. Contains 
   source and target CRS, source points and expected target points. The test 
   suite performs the projection and fires a test failure if the computed points 
   is significantly different than the target points specified in the script. 
   The OpenGIS test script is modified from an OGC script. All other test 
   scripts are Rueben Schulz's work (as far as I know). Rueben did this job as a 
   Geotools contributor.
   
 - wkt for CoordinateReferenceSystem.txt - should confirm source of data?
   Answer for Martin: they are mostly test scripts with comments, source and 
   target points trimmed out. So they are mostly Rueben's derivative work.
