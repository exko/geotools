STATUS: Feb 1st, 2006

This package was split from main for GeoTools 2.4.x; as such the following information was origionally in main/review.txt

org.geotools.data
-----------------
The contents of the data package were overhalled for the GeoTools 2.0 release, 
this package contains the default implementations, and a bit more utility 
classes then can be sensibly figured out.


org.geotools.data.collection
----------------------------
Included to clean up code as part of GeoTools 2.2, common utility classes.

org.geotools.data.memory
------------------------
Created as the API proof of concept for GeoTools 2.0 DataStore API. MemoryDataStore 
added for GeoTools 2.0 (although really a port of DefaulFeatureCollection).

org.geotools.data.ows
---------------------
Added to support OGC Open Web Services constructs, for WMS client code and WFS
 datastore code. Implemened for GeoTools 2.1 as part of the uDig project.

org.geotools.data.store
-----------------------
Remaining code from first cut at supporting metadata, code retained as the start 
of a replacement for AbstractDataStore based on what we have learned. Code 
origionally based on GeoServer internals, for end product see the catalog 
package.


org.geotools.data.view
----------------------
Support read only view on feature source information, port of internal GPL 
GeoServer code donated to PMC.
