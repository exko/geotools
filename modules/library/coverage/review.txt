Note from Martin: 2ie Technologie do not exists anymore. Their work were very closely
related to "Institut de Recherche pour le Développement" (IRD). Actually, IRD was the
funder if I remember right. I wonder if we could remove this last copyright...
(actually merge it with the "Institut de Recherche pour le Développement" copyright,
which I believe is close to what the situation really was).
