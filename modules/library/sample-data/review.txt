==================
Module Maintainer none!

James Macgill is listed as a java developer on this
one, but there is no offical module maintainer. This
module has become more important as maven 2 forces us
into some kind of classloader induced data access madness.

org.geotools
------------
Contains a single TestData class, with
lots of data that it can access using
its jar classloader.
