Here is what I would like to check:
- IP Check, do we have the correct header, is there any IP issues to consider
- Update header to (C) 2008, Open Source Geospatial Foundation (OSGeo)


org.geotools.data
-----------------
This code was revised for the GeoServer 1.2 release as part of GeoTools 2.0, design documentation and research for this effort
is available at http://vwfs.refractions.net/. Additional Java 5 generalization work
introduced for GeoTools 2.5 in the form of DataAccess superclass.
- Update header to (C) 2008, Open Source Geospatial Foundation (OSGeo)
- Headers updated with (C) 2002-2006, GeoTools Project Managment Committee (PMC)
- DataAccess and related classes (added for GeoTools 2.5) had no headers
- GmlObjectStore interfaces added in 2007 to support wfs 1.1 wor had no headers
- ServiceInfo and ResourceInfo taken out of catalog package prior to move

org.geotools.data.collection
----------------------------
Added in GeoTools 2.2 time frame to support closable iterators, mostly used to define additional javadocs.

IP:
- ResourceCollection borrows an idea of a closable iterator from hibernate
- Headers updated (C) 2005-2006, GeoTools Project Managment Committee (PMC)
- Collections API contract referenced from java.util.

org.geotools.data.event
-----------------------
Added in GeoTools 2.2, based on event notification used in uDig (LGPL) allowing for a delta based events relative to a tree root.

IP:
- Headers updated (C) 2005-2006, GeoTools Project Managment Committee (PMC)
- Method names compatible with some Eclipse code that informed origional design uDig event design

org.geotools.feature
org.geotools.feature.collection
org.geotools.feature.visitor
-------------------------------
Added in GeoTools 2.0, based on OGC / ISO feature model.
Revised for GeoTools 2.1 based on GML2 requirements.
Updated in GeoTools 2.2 to support random access, sorting and aggregate functions.

IP:
- 2.0 Headers updated (C) 2002-2006, GeoTools Project Managment Committee (PMC)
- 2.1 Headers updated (C) 2003-2006, GeoTools Project Managment Committee (PMC)
- 2.2 Headers updated (C) 2005-2006, GeoTools Project Managment Committee (PMC)

org.geotools.filter
org.geotools.filter.expression
------------------------------
Added for GeoTools 2.0 as part of Vision for new York, based on OGC Filter specification.
Updated for 2.2 to agree with Filter 1.1 specification.
Updated for 2.3 to agree/extend with GeoAPI interfaces (also Filter 1.1).

IP:
- 2.0 Headers updated (C) 2002-2006, GeoTools Project Managment Committee (PMC)
- 2.2 Headers updated (C) 2005-2006, GeoTools Project Managment Committee (PMC)
- 2.3 Headers updated (C) 2005-2006, GeoTools Project Managment Committee (PMC)

org.geotools.styling
--------------------
Added baed on SLD specification for GeoTools 2.0.
Some constructs like RemoteOWS added for GeoTools 2.1.
Updated to agree with SLD 1.0, added event notification, and made method compatible with GeoAPI 2.0 (GPL Licience) for GeoTools 2.2.

IP:
- 2.0 Headers updated (C) 2002-2006, GeoTools Project Managment Committee (PMC)
- 2.3 Headers updated (C) 2003-2006, GeoTools Project Managment Committee (PMC)
- 2.2 Headers updated (C) 2005-2006, GeoTools Project Managment Committee (PMC)
- method names from GeoAPI 2.0 GPL project, not viewd as serious (and these interfaces will be retired shortly)
- Origional styling code is "Geotools - OpenSource mapping toolkit (C) 2002, Center for Computational Geography" with James Macgill as a contact.

org.geotools.util
-----------------
- ProgressListener: (C) 1999, Pêches et Océans Canada, (C) 2001, Institut de Recherche pour le Développement, before being handed to GeoTools PMC

Modules Coverage
================
This module provides several coverage implementations, with a focus on GridCoverages. This work was begun
in GeoTools 2.0 (2001 at Institut de Recherche pour le Développement), and was revised to work with
OGC based interfaces for GeoTools 2.1 (interfaces hosted by GeoAPI).

Coverage work continues as the focus of a specific GridCoverage branch for GeoTools 2.3. Planned work
continues to work on n dimensional geometry based on ISO based Coverage interfaces (once again hosted by GeoAPI).

org.geotools.coverage
---------------------
Added for GeoTools 2.0, updated to OGC coverage interfaces were prototyped for GeoTools 2.1 and relased to GeoAPI
when ready.
