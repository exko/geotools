MODULE RENDER
=============

org.geotools.renderer
---------------------
Contains a "unified" rendering interface for which several implementations have been
made available.

IP:
- GTRenderer header garbled by code formatter, assume (C) 2005 PMC
- range of (C) found in headers

  (C) 2002, Centre for Computational Geography

- Renderer interface only contained (C) 2002, Centre for Computational Geography, assume
  it was intended to be donated to GeoTools?
  
org.geotools.renderer.lite
--------------------------
Andrea's experimental simplified rendering pipeline, on the grounds that simple
code can be debugged, and go fast.

IP:
- Most code (C) 2002 PMC although the lite renderer was not created yet, assume 2004 based
on other code in the package.
- CustomGlyphRenderer, along with others, lacked header
- LabelCacheDefault had a uDig header to start, but contained 
  
    (C) 2005-2006, Geotools Project Managment Committee (PMC)
    (C) 2004, Refractions Research Inc.
    (c) others
  
  Will need to check with Jesse to see who these others are...
 
- ListenerList which appears to had a uDig header (corrected)
- ListenerList appears to hava JFace javadocs ... this needs to be fixed (or reimplemented)
- TransformedShape also bears the following (C)
   (C) 2003, Geotools Project Managment Committee (PMC)
   (C) 2003, Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement
   
- updated header to (C) 2004-2006 PMC as needed

org.geotools.renderer.lite.gridcoverage2d
-----------------------------------------
Think this was recently added from the coverage branch, (C) says 2002 ... going to guess 2005.
IP:
- updated headers to (C) 2005-2006 PMC

org.geotools.renderer.style
---------------------------
Some code here dates back to 2003, appears to be some cross over with the geovista project (supporting
dynamic style obejcts and the like).

IP:
- updated headers to (C) 2004-2006 PMC as needed

org.geotools.renderer.lite (test)
org.geotools.renderer.style (test)
---------------------------
Fun with JUnit.

IP:
- updated headers as needed
- some test case headers are cleary (C) 2002, so will need to use svn history to sort this module out
- GridCoverageRendererTest had uDig header by mistake
