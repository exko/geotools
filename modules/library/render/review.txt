    Presume copyright transfer from (C) 2002, Centre for Computational Geography

org.geotools.renderer
---------------------
Contains a "unified" rendering interface for which several implementations have been
made available.

  
org.geotools.renderer.lite
--------------------------
Andrea's experimental simplified rendering pipeline, on the grounds that simple
code can be debugged, and go fast.

IP:
- ListenerList appears to hava JFace javadocs ... this needs to be fixed (or reimplemented)


org.geotools.renderer.lite.gridcoverage2d
-----------------------------------------
Think this was recently added from the coverage branch, (C) says 2002 ... going to guess 2005.


org.geotools.renderer.style
---------------------------
Some code here dates back to 2003, appears to be some cross over with the geovista project (supporting
dynamic style obejcts and the like).


org.geotools.renderer.lite (test)
org.geotools.renderer.style (test)
---------------------------
Fun with JUnit.

IP:
- some test case headers are cleary (C) 2002, so will need to use svn history 
  to sort this module out
