  STATUS as of June 2008:
  CLEAN but need confirmation for (c) transfer by:

    * Saul Farber in org.geotools.logging.

    * Touraivane  in org.geotools.metadata.



* org.geotools.factory
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  Basis for a factory implementation, based on java SPI technology forming the 
  core of the geotools plugin system. These constructs we revised for GeoTools 2.1 
  to make use of some JAI and provide a mechanism for "hinting" the lookup process 
  when needed by client applications.

    * FactoryFinder file was based on SAXFactory and is credited


* org.geotools.io
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  Appears to be focused on the usual text suspects, EOL and TAB.


* org.geotools.math
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  Contains formula for a line and other madness, mostly utility classes for 
  elsewhere. 

  * Package html cites the following references:

    * http://www.worldserver.com/turk/opensource/

    * http://mathworld.wolfram.com/


 * org.geotools.metadata.iso.*
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   Created in GeoTools 2.1, these classes provide the basis for ISO based metadata 
   (such as Citation). An attempt was made to provide query support, based on 
   MetadataEntity for GeoTools 2.1. Some very interesting ideas here :-)
 
     * Credit given in header for the abstractions used:
       This package contains documentation from OpenGIS specifications.
       OpenGIS consortium's work is fully acknowledged here.
 
     * Toura√Øvane listed as author on most of module, we need (c) assignment perhaps 
       from IRD
 
 
 * org.geotools.metadata.sql
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   Appears to be low-level support for metadata wrapped over an SQL result set, 
   interested to know if this is used. (Answer: not yet used in Geotools. Used in 
   at least one external project however. It could be used in a future Geotools 
   version as a more convenient and more detailled way to store pre-defined 
   Citations (EPSG, ESRI, etc...) than hard-coded constants.)
 

* org.geotools.resources
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  Seems to be a collection of crazy utility classes.


* org.geotools.resources.geometry
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  Some neat, and more performant implementations for hacking Java 2d.


* org.geotools.resources.i18n
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  Contains a breakdown of resource bundle/property files that have been processed to
  use number based lookup for speed, compile-time safety and to minimize resource use.


* org.geotools.util
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


* org.geotools.util.logging
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    * Saul Farber listed as author for most classes, under review with employer MassGIS
      http://docs.codehaus.org/display/GEOTOOLS/GeoTools+Contributor+Status


* org.geotools.[factory|util|math] (test)
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  Fun with JUnit.
