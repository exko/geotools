PLUGIN HSQL
===========

IP Review Jody Garnett, July 10th, 2007

This module was created by Refractions Research for a uDig based project,
based on a mysterious LICENSE.TXT included in the epsg-hsql project I am
wondering if we need to look into distribution requirements of the hsql
jdbc driver.

org.geotools.data.hsql
org.geotools.data.hsql.fidmapper
org.geotools.filter
org.geotools.data.hsql (test)
--------------------------------
Created to make use of a local java database, hsql. This database is
not spatial enabled, we make use of a post processing for the required
SFSQL functions.

- some test code copied out of memory datastore test
