MODULE GEOMETRY

This module is a formal fork of the JTS Topology Suite version 1.7.2 backed onto
GeoAPI geometry interfaces. This work was undertaken by the University of 
Applied Sciences Köln (Fachhochschule Köln) in 2006.

This work is based on GeoAPI Geometry interfaces which are defined in accordance
with the ISO 19107 specification. The ISO 19107 specification was consulted
during implementation. The occasional javadoc description has been taken
from either GeoAPI or the ISO 19107 specification. It is our understanding that
up to 20% of an ISO specifications may be used during an implementation and we
are well within this limit.

The JTS Topology Suite is property of Vivid Solutions and is available under an
LGPL license. This license requires that we make any modifications to their
code available in source code form. The publication of GeoTools source code
in a public repository meets this requirement.

 - added project description and contact information to the wiki page and package.html
 - reverted all files to standard project header
 - PrecisionModel had the following header, changed the header to just list the
 copyright information (extra details placed onto the wiki and package.html).
