EXT MAPPANE

IP REVIEW:
- Jody Garnett August 1st, 2006

This package is a "rescue" for the origional JStyledMapPane demo code used by GeoTools 2.0, this
code was not updated to the new CRS system and had been neglected. Ian brought together a quick
cut of the important part for GeoTools 2.2, and it will be used by several geotools demos.

org.geotools.gui.swing
----------------------
Looks to be mostly recent IanT code with no headers(!)
IP:
- headers updated to (C) 2006 PMC

org.geotools.gui.swing.resources
--------------------------------
Some of these are part of the swing standard icons, they have their own license (will need to have that looked up)
IP:
- find licence for icons --or--
- remove swing standard and replace with uDig icons?

org.geotools.gui.swing.tools
----------------------------
Looks to be the origional GeoTools 2.0 "tools" framework started by cameron, brough
back from the dead for mappane use.

IP:
- updated headers (C) 2002-2006 PMC
