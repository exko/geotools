/**
 * A read-write store for geospatial information.
 *
 * <p>
 * First draft of a Store interface based on brain storming session with Jody, Thomas,
 * Stefan and Cory in Refractions on November 24th. It has since been reviewed by Jesse who
 * contributed the connection information messages.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>The basic idea is to have simple, general interface to access and query data that is in some way or
 * another spatially enabled. And we don't want the restriction to {@link org.geotools.feature.Feature},
 * {@link org.geotools.feature.FeatureType}, {@link org.geotools.data.FeatureSource}, etc. as we have right
 * now in {@link org.geotools.data.DataStore}.</p>
 * </i>
 *
 * <code>Store</code> extends the <code>Source</code> interfaces with writing capabilities.
 *
 * @source $URL$
 * @version $Id$
 * @since 2.4
 * @deprecated This is a Proposal, we need your feedback!
