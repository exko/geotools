IP Review Jody Garnett July 10th, 2006

The Graph module was started as part of the Java Confulation Project, this port was made avaialable
to the GeoTools community and feature module by Refractions Research as part of the Validating
Web Feature Server project funded by GeoConnections Canada. Earlier versions of this library
were released under GPL to the JCP (a series of JUMP plugins). Refractions Research retained
copyright and donated the port to GeoTools in 2003.

This seems to draw the initial (C) data at 2003 ... but only the module maintainer
knows for sure.
