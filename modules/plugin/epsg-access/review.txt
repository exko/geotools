PLUGIN EPSG ACCESS
==================
Module Maintainer Martin Desruisseaux
IP Review Jody Garnett, July 8th, 2006

Although initial headers have a (C) 2002-2006 it appears that the file was first created
in (C) (C) 2005, Institut de Recherche pour le Développement so I am adjusting the headers
and LICENSE.txt to match. Given that a GeoTools (C) also appears I can assume the code
was handed over to the PMC without incident.

Their is *no data* included with this module, instead a single Access.html file is included
with the javadocs describing what needs to be done to download and set up the access database.

- LICENSE.txt updated to (C) 2005-2006 GeoTools Project Management Committee (PMC)
