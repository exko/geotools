The PostGIS module works with code from the pre GeoTools 2.0 release (the FeatureStore code for update
etc is a direct port of this earlier code). We will record the (C) range as 2002-2006 with the
understanding that it may in fact be earlier.

Much origional of the origional work was done by Rob Hranac for TOPP, this was taken up by Chris Holmes
for the GeoTools 2.0 release. Work is on going with many optimizations made available for uDig use in
GeoTools 2.1, development continues to present.
