Plugin EPSG-EXT
===============
Module Maintainer: Martin Desruisseaux

The EPSG-EXT module is derived from the EPSG-WKT module. The "esri.properties"
and "extra.properties" files in EPST-EXT are derived from "epsg.properties" in
EPSG-WKT.    The IP review done by Jody Garnett for EPSG-WKT on July 9th, 2006
applies to EPSG-EXT as well. This review is copied below with some adaptations
for the new directory layout in EPSG-EXT. See SVN history for a list of changes.

IP Review, Jody Garnett, July 9th, 2006

The LICENSE.TXT indicated 2002 as a (C) date, this would be an error as the files date from 2004.
The (re) distribution of epsg.properties requires clairfication, asked Paul Ramsey for advice
via email.

************ insert by Adrian Custer, Jan 2008
Beginning 2008, got a response from Paul:

All public information.

http://edndoc.esri.com/arcims/9.2/elements/pcs.htm
http://edndoc.esri.com/arcims/9.2/elements/gcs.htm

But the website is governed by the painfully closed terms of use:
  http://edn.esri.com/index.cfm?fa=misc.termsOfUse
==> Still needs clarification

-------------------------------------
Code contains a few basic property files based pseudo-EPSG Authority. The WKT definitions
contained are a derived data product from the PostGIS project, modifed to hack around
limitations in early GeoTools.
