Plugin EPSG HSQL
----------------
Module Maintainer: Martin
IP Review Jody Garnett, July 9th, 2006

This module presents something interesting, the LICENSE.txt contains both the standard GeoTools
header information in addition a (C) 2001-2004, The HSQL Development Group and a disclaimer to
be maintained with the source code.

More alarmingly the text of the HSQL Developerment Group asks us to include their disclaimer with
"in the documentation and/or other materials provided with the distribution".

As a library I am hard pressed to pass on this constraint to applications that make use of
our software.

Please note I cannot find this notice on *any* code header in contained in this module, perhaps
it is in reference to the jdbc driver jar itself that is required for the module to be of use?

   [Martin note: I confirm that the HSQL license applies to the "hsqldb.jar" file bundled with our
    binary distribution only. There is no HSQL derived work in Java source code in this module.]

Secondly this module includes data generated from the EPSG access database, would like to see
the details of distribution (and redistribution) documented somewhere please.

Immidiate Action:
- include their disclaimer in our Developers Guide
- include snapshot of developers guide with each release (as our only formal documentation)

Questions:
- I cannot what software the disclaimer is used for
  [Martin answer: the "hsqldb.jar" file only - no impact on any source code provided in this module]

- Requiring disclaimers in software that uses our library would be an unacceptable annoyance
  [Martin answer: it would actually apply only to users of "gt2-epsg-hsql.jar" plugin]

- we could drop hsql or make downloading the jar a seperate option as with arcsde/db2 etc...

IP:
- LICENSE.TXT updated to (C) 2005-2006, GeoTools Project Managment Committee (PMC)
- LICENSE.TXT contains disclaimer with annoying restrictions on use

QA:
- readme.txt added describing installation needs
  [Martin answer: removed the information, because they were target for module maintainer, not for users.
   Added a note for user explaining that they don't need to take any particular action for installing this module.]
