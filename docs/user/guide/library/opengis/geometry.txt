ISO Geometry
------------

The OpenGIS module defines a set of interfaces aligned with the ISO 19107 Geometry Specification.

These interfaces are many, varied, and well documented. The problem is they are not useful.

* They are complex (in comparison to the Simple Feature Specification used by JTS)
* The two implementations are unsupported modules

GeoTools has two full implementations of these interfaces:

* Geometry Plugin a port of JTS 1.7 to the ISO Geometry interfaces
* JTS Wrapper Plugin an implementation that delegates all the work to JTS

You should only include one on your CLASSPATH at any point in time.

* Which implementation should I use?
  
  Neither - unless you have a direct need for these implementations
  (because you are limiting your project to ISO19107 only interfaces)
  they are not recommended.
  
  * The JTS-Wrapper implementation is field tested, but limited to
    constructs similar to JTS. On the bright side because it always
    uses the latest JTS the performance of this implementation has
    improved over time.
  
  * The Geometry module has now had a lot of testing; but since it
    is a port of JTS 1.7 it will lag behind JTS in speed. It is
    however less complicated in terms of duplication of
    information.

* How do I use ISO Geometry
  
  Check out the documentation for the unsupported Geometry Plugin.
  There is a nice series of source code examples.
