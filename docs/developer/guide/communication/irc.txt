Internet Relay Chat
-------------------
GeoTools developers use an IRC channel for real time collaboration (for situations where email is too slow) - this is also a suitable venue for questions.
If you are new to IRC, you will need to find an IRC client. The later versions of Netscape and Mozilla have IRC built in, and you can connect to a GeoTools meeting simply by using the URL:
irc://irc.freenode.net/geotools.

The information you need to configure your IRC client are:
* Server - Pick one from Freenode Servers
* Channel - #geotools
* Port - 6667

Logs from IRC meetings are stored on this wiki:

IRC Breakout Meetings
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Occasionally breakout IRC meetings will be announced on the geotools-devel mailing list around specific topics of interest.
Anyone is free to start a meeting; we ask that an email be sent out and a time negotiated on the email list allowing interested parties to attend.
