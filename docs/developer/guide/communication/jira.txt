Issue Tracker
-------------------

GeoTools tracks tasks, issues and bugs with its JIRA tracker, generously provided by Atlassian and hosted by CodeHaus.

This is where all bugs should be reported, in addition to requested features and improvements.
* http://jira.codehaus.org/secure/BrowseProject.jspa?id=10270

Filling out all fields is specially important for bug reports:
* including component(s)
* affected versions of geotools ( a release or code from SVN? )
* A description of what caused the problem (example code that reproduces the problem) along with any stack traces
* The Java Version and the type of operating system you are using
* You may wish to attach log files, or screen snapshots to the Jira task
* If you are reporting failed tests during the maven build, check the test reports in <module>/target/surefire-reports for further details
