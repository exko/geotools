GeoTools 2.0 Documentation
==========================

The following pages were used to collection information for the GeoTools 2.0 release - information is being migrated to the user guide as needed.

* Tutorials - Use for lessons and discussions, with sample code, about the geotools codebase. Such tutorials can be printed out and referenced as the library is learned. UML diagrams are also common here.

* Snippets - A place for small pieces of sample code that do not have to be full worked examples. Some Snippets may latter be further developed into tutorials.

* Articles Non-coding documents (miscellaneous).

* FAQ - Answers to questions that new users and developers may have.

* RnD - Proposed new features for the geotools library.

* Home - (aka Developers Guide) A place for project procedures and standards.

* Reference - A list of abbreviations and acronyms. New references are added as children pages to the reference pages. If you want to go the extra mile you can provide an information hierarchy for things like OGC Specifications, GIS Terms, Definitions and so on.
