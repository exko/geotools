Welcome and Tutorials
======================

The Welcome section of the Users Guide is devoted to introduction material and tutorials.

Since there is no module maintainer for overview and background knowledge of this nature we need to be very careful that it is always up to date.

All example code used in the wiki must be present in the demo folder.
By making use of the demo folder we will ensure that the code:

* Compiles and Functions
* Is kept up todate as API changes occur

It is the responsibility of those making an API change to update the example code, and associated wiki pages. Please be kind and include a link to the wiki page in your demo code javadocs.

Guidelines for Writing
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When writing for the welcome section please consider the target audience as experienced in Java, but not experienced with spatial constructs and ideas. We must focus on results, not correctness.

Here are some examples:

* Introduce the concept of a Feature, but not Java Generics
* Show first, explain after - given your target audience showing them the source code first will put them at ease. That way when you are talking about what a Feature means afterwords they will know to pay attention (it is after all a real concept that they must deal with in the form of a Java interface).
* Leave the specifications out of it as much as possible. You can link to the specifications as "related information", and talk about ideas such as ISO Geometry - but do not drive people crazy. They are here to get a job done - it is your job to understand the specification so they do not have to.
* You can create a "Welcome for..." page if you have a different target audience in mind.

Use of Example Code
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Please add any example code to the demo/example project; so you can be sure it compiles.
