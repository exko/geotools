Introduction

This guide is intended for programmers wishing to improve the GeoTools library itself.  The User Guide is intended for programmers wishing to use GeoTools as a code library.

Think of this document as the “Care and Feeding” instructions we used to create the library for your use.

Document Overview
-------------------

This document provides comprehensive java software development processes tailored for open source projects. It covers processes, conventions, and recommended tools. The guide aims to help developers quickly get up to speed with best practices. You are not expected to read this guide cover-to-cover. You probably should be familiar with the contents and reference the appropriate section when you need it. Documentation aims to be concise with references elsewhere on the web for details like installation instructions.

This guide is written in a modular fashion so that different projects can easily add, delete, or modify sections. It is hoped that this guide will become the de-facto standard software developers guide for java-based open source projects. For this guide to be useful it needs to be continually added to and improved as tools are developed, processes improved and projects grow.

Please consider improving or adding a section if you feel it is required. Only free, cross-platform tools are recommended here. Where applicable, widely-accepted conventions and open standards are used. It has been satisfying to discover the breadth of quality free and open source tools which support software development. It is hoped that this document will highlight areas where tools can be improved or developed and encourage developers to focus on these areas. This guide has been used as the basis for Generguide - A Generic Software Developer's Guide.

System Overview
-------------------

GeoTools is an open source, Java GIS toolkit for developing standards compliant solutions. Its modular architecture allows extra functionality to be easily incorporated.

GeoTools aims to support OpenGIS and other relevant standards as they are developed. GeoTools code is built using the latest Java tools and environments and will continue to leverage the capabilities of future Java environments and official extensions as and when the technologies are released and have been through the first maintenance cycle.

It is not the intention of the GeoTools project to develop finished products or applications, but it is the intention to interact and support fully other initiatives and projects which would like to use the GeoTools toolkit to create such resources.

The GeoTools project is divided into separate modules, each of which implements a specific requirement. Only a subset of these modules is usually required to build an application based on GeoTools.
